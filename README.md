# Credit_Risk_Analysis_1819
University project "European Open Banking for credit risk analysis" given by Scytale company, made for the course of Requirements Engineering. In this project, the team developed, through a whole semester, a document (Volere Model) in which all the requirements needed for the possible future system implementation were detailed. The main goal of the future system would be to "calculate", through the analysis of bank statements and with the help of bank accounts API's, the credit risk of potential customers and thus create best offers. All the holders authorized the analysis to their bank statements.
